# MCP Terminal Tester - Progress Tracking

## Current Status
- **Date**: June 11, 2025  
- **Phase**: Phase 3 IN PROGRESS 🚧
- **Overall Progress**: 75% - Integration tests added, 13/18 passing

## Active Tasks
1. **Phase 3: Full Tool Suite** - READY TO START
   - Improve error handling throughout
   - Performance optimization
   - Create more comprehensive test suite
   - Documentation and examples

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation
- ✅ Created .gitignore for Go project
- ✅ Initial project planning and architecture design
- ✅ Created progress tracking system
- ✅ Initialized Go module
- ✅ Created project directory structure
- ✅ Installed all dependencies (mcp-go, pty, uuid)
- ✅ Created basic MCP server skeleton
- ✅ Implemented session manager foundation
- ✅ Created session struct and types
- ✅ Implemented all 9 MCP tool handlers
- ✅ Created terminal/PTY wrapper
- ✅ Created screen buffer implementation
- ✅ Created ANSI parser (basic version)
- ✅ Created Makefile
- ✅ Successfully built the project

### Phase 2: Core Features
- ✅ Added structured logging throughout codebase
- ✅ Enhanced ANSI parser with CSI, SGR, OSC, DCS support
- ✅ Implemented terminal resizing with resize_terminal tool
- ✅ Added scrollback buffer support (1000 lines)
- ✅ Fixed output format differences (raw now includes ANSI)
- ✅ Created echo test application
- ✅ Created menu test application with navigation
- ✅ Created progress bar animation test
- ✅ Written unit tests for ANSI parser
- ✅ Written unit tests for session manager
- ✅ Written unit tests for screen buffer
- ✅ Added test targets to Makefile
- ✅ Fixed all failing unit tests
- ✅ Implemented proper renderRaw() with ANSI sequences
- ✅ Added scrollback format to Render() method
- ✅ Fixed cursor save/restore to be per-parser instead of global

### Phase 3: Advanced Features  
- ✅ Created comprehensive integration test framework
- ✅ Added tests for all 9 MCP tools
- ✅ Fixed parameter type handling (int/float64) in ResizeTerminal
- ✅ 13 out of 18 integration tests passing
- 🚧 Session restart needs readLoop lifecycle management
- 🚧 Scrollback format test needs fixing
- 🚧 ANSI output preservation in raw format
- ⏳ Error recovery from PTY crashes
- ⏳ Input validation for all tools
- ⏳ Performance optimizations
- ⏳ Advanced terminal features (mouse support)

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Test the server with actual MCP client
2. Test with real terminal applications (vim, less, htop, nano)
3. Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Add performance optimizations (buffer pooling, etc.)
5. Create comprehensive integration tests
6. Write user documentation and examples
7. Test cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Decision History

### 2025-01-10
- **Decision**: Use Go for implementation
  - *Rationale*: Performance, strong concurrency support, good PTY libraries
  
- **Decision**: Use mark3labs/mcp-go SDK
  - *Rationale*: Well-maintained Go implementation of MCP protocol
  
- **Decision**: Use creack/pty for terminal handling
  - *Rationale*: Cross-platform support, active maintenance, simple API
  
- **Decision**: UUID v4 for session IDs
  - *Rationale*: Guaranteed uniqueness, no coordination required
  
- **Decision**: 80x24 default terminal size
  - *Rationale*: Standard terminal size, widely compatible

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE ✅)
- [x] Project structure
- [x] Go module initialization
- [x] Core dependencies
- [x] Basic MCP server
- [x] Session manager skeleton
- [x] All 8 MCP tools implemented
- [x] PTY wrapper
- [x] Screen buffer
- [x] ANSI parser
- [x] Build system

### Phase 2: Core Features (COMPLETE ✅)
- [x] Enhanced PTY integration with resize support
- [x] Screen buffer system with scrollback
- [x] Comprehensive ANSI parser

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Current)

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Cross-platform testing
- [ ] Advanced terminal features (mouse support, etc.)

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Error handling

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Examples

## Technical Debt & Issues
- None yet (project just starting)

## Performance Metrics
- Target: Handle 100+ concurrent sessions
- Target: <10ms response time for view_screen
- Target: <1ms input latency

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for MCP tools
3. Test apps: echo server, menu system, vim-like editor
4. Stress tests for concurrent sessions
5. Edge cases: special characters, Unicode, control sequences

## Notes for Next Session
- Start with go mod init
- Create directory structure as specified in project.md
- Begin with minimal MCP server that can register tools
- Focus on getting launch_app working first
- Use simple test app (like `echo`) for initial testing

## Open Questions
1. Should we support terminal resize after launch?
2. How to handle very large scrollback buffers?
3. Should we implement session persistence?
4. Rate limiting for input events?

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: PTY handling differences across platforms
  - *Mitigation*: Test on Linux, macOS, Windows early
  
- **Risk**: ANSI parsing complexity
  - *Mitigation*: Start with basic sequences, iterate
  
- **Risk**: Memory leaks from unclosed sessions
  - *Mitigation*: Implement proper cleanup, use defer
